# IBUtils
The application IBUtils is designed for simplifying database design for Interbase and Firebird databases by showing the links between the tables in your database visually, like some CASE tools do. Every change to the tables in your database made by other tools can be refreshed by one mouse click. You can create tables and tables relations too. Changes to database are logged into a file.
